# CMPM147-FINAL

This is our final draft and everything has been add.We first Create a basic Galaxy by using code to keep all the planets have some distance, different speed and rotating around the middle. Then we worked on the meteor shower that was also controlled by the code. It can go from any direction, but we think going from top left to bottom right will be enjoyable. Finally, We add a hidden background that the star will be twinklin, but it is not obvious, just to make it more interesting. Also Creating a music that really matches our theme.

Thank you for your viewing
